      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I’m a senior at the University of Southern California studying Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Physics. I enjoy exploring new technology, flying airplanes, and various other motorsports. I’ve been programming since I was a freshman in high school and over the last several years I’ve experimented with a little bit of everything. I have experience with programming languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript, and Assembly. I have also worked in/with Linux systems administration, cluster management/containerization with Docker, common SQL/noSQL databases, and UI technologies like ReactJS. Beyond computer science I enjoy studying physics and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently work as a research intern at Sandia National Laboratories. I conduct research in machine learning as it relates to cyber security (See Resume for further details). While my current research is in a specific field, my interest in ML/AI and its application is more broad. I am also interested in several other fields like hardware acceleration and quantum computing.&lt;/p&gt;
